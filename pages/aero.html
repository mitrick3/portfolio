            <p>	Duke AERO is the premier aerospace engineering club at Duke, each year designing and building a high-powered rocket to compete at Spaceport America Cup. I joined my sophomore year and worked on Pitchfork, a rocket for SAC’s 10k foot SRAD (Student Researched and Developed) Motor category.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>	As a member of the Structures and Manufacturing Subteam, my work focused on the actual building of the rocket. I milled, turned, and tapped aluminum parts. I also gained a ton of experience in composite manufacture, working on wet and prepreg layups for body tubes and couplers. I even worked on novel “forged carbon” parts, using a combination of chopped tow and 3d printed molds. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>	Pictured Top and Middle is the lower half of the airbrake housing, which I turned on the lathe and milled on a Centroid CNC Mill. Manufacturing that piece of the rocket was a great learning experience, and also gave me a deep appreciation for the time that machining takes (~5 hours of operating a manual lathe for that step). 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>	Pictured bottom is my team completing a tip-to-tip carbon fiber layup on our fins. We used composite fins and forged carbon fillets to attach the fins to the rocket. The fins were a composite “sandwich” with an internal PCB (to measure strain) printed on G10 fiberglass. The layers were as follows (CF G10 CF G10-Core CF G10-PCB CF). On the night pictured we unmounted the fins after a failed first attempt, remounted, and completed the tip-to-tip. This turned out to be a just under twelve-hour work session, but I can say that it was well worth it. Even after a catastrophic flight event during our launch at Spaceport that summer we recovered the power section of our rocket with the fins fully intact. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>	At Spaceport in Las Cruces, we received the Jim Furfaro Award for Technical Excellence, in recognition of our team achieving the best design and build of 150 teams. Despite a less than nominal flight, we left New Mexico winners.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>	I am excited to continue my work with Duke Aero this coming year, as we design and build to compete in the 30k SRAD category this coming year. I plan to continue my work with the Structures and Manufacturing Subteam, but also to work on my skills with electronics on the Avionics Subteam.
