            <p>I am a Project Lead for the Duke Chapter of the national Global Research and Consulting Group, which is an undergraduate club that connects nonprofits looking for business strategy help to undergraduates interested in developing consulting skills while supporting non-profit missions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was a member of the team working for Compassion International, a global charity focused on helping youths worldwide through their educational program. My specific research and presentation focused on engaging past program participants, and finding an existing model for the charity to follow as they began to scale the organization. I focused on successful startup incubators in the third world, and presented their models and how they could be applied to Compassionâ€™s charity work.</p>
            <br>
            <p>	I became the Team Lead for my second project with GRC, which was researching fundraising strategy for ARC Thrift Stores. ARC is a large thrift store chain that exists to provide gainful employment for thousands of Americans with developmental differences. My team focused on researching the fundraising strategies of Tunnels To Towers, and whether ARC could employ similar strategies. We presented our findings to ARC's CEO.
