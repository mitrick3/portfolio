            <p>	A little while ago I decided it was important to establish an online presence showcasing my work and project experience. After spending some time looking at some of my peers similar attempts I found one that I found incredibly impressive. I also learned that he had built the website himself. I will admit to being a bit competitive, and knowing another student built his website made me want to do the same. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>	While I was working at Laramie Energy I took some time out of my evenings to learn HTML/CSS/JS, with the eventual goal of building my portfolio website. I must give much credit to CodeBro's YouTube series. By the end of my job I felt confident, and got to work. This website is the result. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>	I would not recommend doing as I did, but I am glad to take some skills out of it. I am confident in my ability to build basic sites with HTML/CSS/JS, and have created this website free of cost with the exception of the unavoidable cost of the domain name.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>	I will also admit to using Gen AI as much as I could. I wish I were able to use it more, as when I was able to apply it I saved myself a lot of time. I particularly liked Claude Sonnet when I could get free prompts and ChatGPT 3.5 when I couldnâ€™t. </p>
